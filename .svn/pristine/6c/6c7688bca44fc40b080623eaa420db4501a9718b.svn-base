The Fastest & Easiest Way To Keep Your Staging Site Synced With New Content From Your Live Site.

== Description ==

This plugin was developed because we saw this as a common but solvable problem that many designers and developers face when doing things like redesigning websites.

With this plugin, you’ll be able to sync any new content changes that happen on the live site to your staging site while you are working on it.

Gone are the days where you have to copy over new blog posts and comments that happened on the live site while you were working on the staging site, from now on your staging site will always remain up to date making it faster and easier than ever to push your staging site live!
